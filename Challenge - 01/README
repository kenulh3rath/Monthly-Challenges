*PROMPT:*
You are tasked with writing a function that will return an array or vector of factors of a number which the user has entered. For example if a user has entered 12. The factors of 12 will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Note: You should do some basic validation making sure that the user only enters a positive integer and is not zero. You can code this challenge in any language you want. I want these challenges to be creative. You can even code it in Assembly just kidding but if you can do it.

***EXAMPLE TESTS:***
12 --> should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
7 --> should return [1, 7]
1 --> should return [1]
456 --> should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 19, 24, 38, 57, 76, 114, 152, 228, 456]
